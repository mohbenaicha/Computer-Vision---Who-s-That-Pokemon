# Deep learning projects

1) Computer vision for classification using CNNs and AlexNet for distinguishing Pokemon characters;

2) Natural language processing for classification using language models for detecting hate speech term project;

3) Natural language processing for topic modelling using language models for detecting patterns in hate speech final project (coming soon);

The image scraper script is in script and notebook formats. NOTE: To execute script, ensure dependencies (selenium and requests) are installed in the environment on which scraper is run before hand. Also to note, a Chrome window will pop up after running the script, do not close it. 


Mini projects include:

Image classification and transfer learning using VGG16 mini-project; 

Image generation using CVAE - convolutional variational auto encoders mini-project;

Natural language processing for semantic similarity using TFIDG, GloVe and BERT mini-project;
